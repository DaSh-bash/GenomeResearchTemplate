# Genome Research template for LaTeX

This repository contains a LaTeX template following the guidelines required for publication in the journal Genome Research. It also includes example files for the input and PDF output.

It uses luaLaTeX for compiling the LaTeX document. For the bibliography, it uses BibLaTeX with biber as backend.

This example uses fonts similar to those used by Genome Research in the final document, but you may have different fonts installed in your system. If you compile the doc and run into trouble with the fonts, just open the `GR.cls` file and change the fonts to your preferred ones.
